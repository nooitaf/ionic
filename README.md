WIP: Empty project!
===================
**This package is still under development and was not yet published!**

accounts-templates-ionic
========================

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for Ionic

This package depends on [accounts-templates-core](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor-useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](http://accounts-templates.meteor.com) or have a look at a [live demo application](http://accounts-templates-ionic.meteor.com) or at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core).

## Warning!

Adding this package with `meteor add accounts-templates-ionic` does not add any other packages providing Ionic. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!
